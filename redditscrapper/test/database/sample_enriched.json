              "body": "This isn't entirely related to your comment, but I thought it might interest some people (this will probably be quite long). \n\nMy grandmother was born in 1930 in Germany. She is still alive, and yes, she is very concerned about Trump and the entire state of the world, which probably isn't a good sign. However, I do believe that Germany in the 1940s is proof that things can change politically (eventhough the denazification process was very flawed in many ways). This is how my grandmother viewed that process. (Keep in mind that these are personal anecdotes. My grandmother is from the north of Germany, so they might not apply to everywhere in Germany) \n\nAfter the war was over Germany (or what remained of it) was a huge mess politically and in basically any other way as well. The Nazis had banned all political parties and political meet-ups were regularly punished via death penalty. During the first momths of occupation political parties and meet-ups remained banned. Eventually, as local elections started being planned, political parties were allowed to exist again. Many people who had been part of a non-nazi party before the nazis gained power rejoined that party. My grandmother's parents had been part of the SPD, so they rejoined the SPD, for example. In many cases this was quite emotional for the people. My grandmother's father cried. However, in some ways this was also harder than it might sound. Especially when it came to the SPD (social democrats) and KPD (communists). Many party leaders had fled the country, gotten executed or suffered extreme health issues, due to being tortured or in other ways mistreated by the nazis. Others died in the war or had gotten displaced. \n\nHowever, there were also plenty of people who had lost faith in democracy as a whole. The Weimar republic was still on everyone's mind. A republic that started with a horrible inflation and ended in one of the worst (if not the worst) dictatorships to have ever existed. \n\nThere were a lot of monarchists who yearned for the \"good old days\" under the Kaiser. When it was announced that Germany's flag would be the black-red-yellow one (the same one that the Weimar Republic used) a popular saying went around:\"Gold war die Vergangenheit, Rot ist die Gegenwart, Schwarz ist die Zukunft\". \nGold is the past (German Empire under the Kaiser), red is the present (ww2/aftermath of it), black is the future (the new federal republic of Germany. Which was famously split in half). My grandmother recalls arguing with one of the monarchists, who then told her that democracy is bad, because democracy is what got them Hitler. My grandmother had family members in Bavaria. There there was a huge bavarian independence movement, which was also quite heavily monarchist and wanted to reinstate the Bavarian King. \n\nSpirituality was also a huge thing. There were many \"Fortune tellers\", who in the vast majority of cases were just scammers trying to get rich off of desperate people. Nonetheless, there were many people willing to invest their last valuables into having a stranger tell them that their 16 year old son is obviously still alive somewhere and isn't dead in a ditch. Obviously. Others turned heavily to christianity. \n\nThen you also had the expellees from the east, the \"Heimatvertriebene\", who mad up some 20% of West-Germany's population after the war. Political parties tried HARD to cater to them (you couldn't miss out on those sweet 20% of votes) and basically everyone took advantage of them in some way. The city where my grandmother is from, Oldenburg, went from ~80k inhabitants in 1939, to 120k by 1948. Pretty much all 40k of these people were reffugees from the east. The rural areas surrounding their city took in even more. These people were treated horribly by the other germans, even the children.\n\nYou also had many people who had grown up basically only knowing dicatorship, who were now suddenly expected to vote. My grandmother was lucky to have been raised in a democratic, non-nazi household, but many other people weren't (there were also a lot of families were the parents were anti-nazi, but the children weren't. Nazism was much more popular among young people). Even for her, it was hard to adjust. \n\nPeople were also very paranoid. There was a lot of fear surrounding the government, police, etc... There was also always the fear that a war would break out between the Wester allies and the soviet Union. Particularly around the time of the Berlin airlift in 1948/49. There was little trust and solidarity among germans. \nMy grandmother has always told me one story: Shortly after the war ended, she was queuing in a line to get bread. A small fight broke out and a pregnant woman ended up being pushed around. When someone told the others to be careful, because the pregnant lady might get hurt, another woman loudly screamed something along the lines of:\"Who cares? That baby was probably meant to be a gift for Hitler!\". The pregnant woman initially tried to defend herself, then started crying and ran off. A woman, who was standing behind the pregnant lady, happily said to her friend:\"Great! Now that she's gone we'll get our bread quicker!\". I think that says a lot. \n\nWhen elections came in 1949, nobody was truly happy or optimistic. Mainly because nobody was truly happy or optimistic when it came to the new federal republic of Germany, that was now meant to be their home. Especially those who had family in the German democratic republic, East Germany. Nonetheless, 75% of people voted and in the end a democatic government was formed. Shortly thereafter, the \"Wirtschaftswunder\" (economic miracle) came and things improved. In the 60s the \"Vergessenheitskultur\" (Culture of forgetting) was replaced by the \"Erinnerungskultur\" (Culture of remembering), as the post-war generation grew up and started asking more questions about the nazis. In the 90s the Berlin wall finally came down and Germany reunited 11 months later. \n\nAgain, this is a very long post, but I think some people might be interested in reading it. This is mostly based on things that my grandmother told me, so do keep that in mind. If you have any questions, you can ask them and I'll answere them myself, or I can ask my grandmother as well, if anyone wants that.",

I think ice is being far too easily aggressive (sometimes) and that should be fixed. I think Trump should do more about that, but the goal of ice is to make sure there aren't people illegally living in America, and that's the ice that trump supports and wants in America. It's the same with how we need police officers and there are rare cases of police officers killing innocents. That doesn't mean get rid of police officers and you cannot assume all police are corrupt. You also can't point fingers at Trump for that.",

My arguments are more so his policies and presidency, not personality. If he was one of the worst presidents ever, explain why. Don't just be a condescending &amp; arrogant fool.",

Yeah, completely scrubbed from the Internet faster than you can say \u201ccancelled.\u201d\n\nMaybe this is what Taylor Swift meant by cancelled??\n\nAnyway, then out of nowhere, eight months ago, Ivanka shows up online wearing a 2012 Gossip Girl dress that wore Blake.\n\nAllegedly blackface blake pushed ivanka to be on the show too? Oh, and that episode aired on Ivanka and Jared\u2019s first wedding anniversary on the 25th of October.  Cute, right?\n\nThe article that mentions this ALSO scrubbed off the Internet ( we have a copy in the pictures ).\n\nAs most of us know , Blake\u2019s name popped up in the Epstein saga (on brand), and rumor has it she was cozy with Weinstien. 2 known predators cozy with her in one lifetime? Score!\n\nSoooo... is Ivanka sending secret love notes? And is the White House playing puppet master behind the scenes? Is this why Ryan goes around boasting he's a very powerful man?\n\nTo nobody's surprise : Blake\u2019s &amp; ryan are racist, no receipts needed. &amp; guess who else is riding that racist train? Our favorite orange disaster, Taco Trump, who\u2019s busy declaring WAR on immigrants while playing the ultimate divide-and-conquer game with ICE.\n\nThe dots shouldn't be so hard to connect.\n\n\ud83d\udd34Blake \u2796\ufe0f\ud83d\udd34 Ivanka\u2796\ufe0f\ud83d\udd34 Donald \u2796\ufe0f\ud83d\udd34Jeffrey\n\nSo, somebody ought to ask ,why the ghost-from-the-past 2012 fall dress, Ivanka?\n\nShe isn't exactly the \u201cparty all night\u201d type, and yet here she was dressing up to go \"out\" . Ironically not a SINGLE pic of ivanka actually leaving the house in it , or at any venue.\n\nWas it A wink-wink nod to Blake and their shady elite squad?\n\nJust like that stupid pap walk with salma who for exactly 24 hrs played auntie to ryan's children and fffked off into the night like crackhead discount mary Poppins.\n\nBut what do we know , its all alleged &amp; tea. 4 Entertainment &amp; grains of salt.",
